This is an very old project and with an old C++ style, be sure to tweak it to your needs before using
it.

It is a toy example of how to play with SMTP protocol
    - Connect to a remote SMTP server
    - Handle multiple destinatory
    - false sender email
    - Custom ASCII art in the message source
    - Handle attachments (base64 convertion and mime part)

Be sure that your firewall allow you to connect directly to an SMTP server
(port 25), in France most internet box does not allow that by default for
security reason
